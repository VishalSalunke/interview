| Sr No | Title             | Problem statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Run command                          | Path                                  |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Factorial         | Find the factorial of given number  | `node DS-examples/factorial.js`      | [Code](DS-examples/factorial.js)      |
| 2     | Anagram string    | An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, "abcd" and “dabc” are an anagram of each other. Examples: Input: str1 = "listen" str2 = "silent" | `node DS-examples/anagram-string.js` | [Code](DS-examples/anagram-string.js) |
| 3     | Longest substring | find the longest substring without repeating character | `node DS-examples/longest-string.js` | [Code](DS-examples/longest-string.js) |
| 4     | Two sum   | Given in array of integers find two number such that they add up to specific target | `node DS-examples/two-sum.js` | [Code](DS-examples/two-sum.js) |
| 5     | Missing number    | Find missing number in array of consecutive numbers | `node DS-examples/missing-number.js` | [Code](DS-examples/missing-number.js) |
| 6     | Reverse string    | Reverse the given string | `node DS-examples/reverse-string.js` | [Code](DS-examples/reverse-string.js) |
| 7     | Remove duplicates    | Remove duplicates from array | `node DS-examples/remove-duplicates.js` | [Code](DS-examples/remove-duplicates.js) |
| 8     | Palindrome    | A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards | `node DS-examples/palindrome.js` | [Code](DS-examples/palindrome.js) |
| 9     | Fibonacci    | The Fibonacci series is an infinite series, starting from '0' and '1', in which every number in the series is the sum of two numbers preceding it in the series. | `node DS-examples/fibonacci.js` | [Code](DS-examples/fibonacci.js) |
| 10     | Armstrong    | A number is thought of as an Armstrong number if the sum of its own digits raised to the power number of digits gives the number itself. For example, 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 are three-digit Armstrong numbers and, 1634, 8208, 9474 are four-digit Armstrong numbers and there are many more | `node DS-examples/armstrong.js` | [Code](DS-examples/armstrong.js) |
| 11    | Stock price    | Consider a given array [7,1,5,3,6,4] representing the stock prices of a particular company for the next 6 days. For instance, today's price is 7, tomorrow's is 1, and so on, with the price being 4 on the 6th day. Your task is to find the maximum profit that can be earned from buying and selling stocks within these 6 days. Additionally, please display both the buy price and the sale price to achieve this maximum profit | `node DS-examples/stock-price-problem.js` | [Code](DS-examples/stock-price-problem.js) |
